### Preface

A coworker recently mentioned a project to me. He couldn't think of the name but described it as a "reboot of an old phone with a kickout keyboard that runs Linux". I instantly new he was talking about the n900, and we figured out [neo900](http://neo900.org/) was the aformentioned project. I read up on the project and thought it was a bit of an investment for a phone I'm not sure I'd like. The only reason I knew about the n900 was because a friend in college used one and showed me a lot of cool things on it, but I never owned one myself.

So I bought an n900 on eBay in 2016. Not to replace my current phone but to have what I find to be an impressive mobile Linux device that fits in my pocket.

What lies ahead consists of my research to modernize the software on the device amongst a sea of dead links in a niche community.


### Initial Research

First things first, eventhough the phone came with Maemo 5, **I want to wipe the device and start fresh**

This process also entailed trying to understand the past five years of the ecosystem around the n900.

The chart below is a diagram of Tizen's history, you can see Maemo 5 in the middle left, starting from the Debian root.

### Flashing Firmware

#### Required Data Files

eMMC (VANILLA) & FIASCO (COMBINED)

> (flashing the) eMMC aka *VANILLA*, which will replace the complete content of N900’s internal 32 GB storage (embedded MMC), which is: the /home partition which has your stored browser passwords and game highscores and calendar and contacts etc. /home is also containing /opt. Plus eMMC stores all the content of the MyDocs 28 GB VFAT partition, where all the media and docs and other user content lives.

> (flashing the) FIASCO aka *COMBINED*, also referred to as “rootfs” though this file and flashing process also consists of / affects NOLO bootloader (the several stages), the kernel, and usually the GSM modem firmware, in addition to the root filesystem which is basically the content of your 240 MB NAND flash storage and implements the Linux operating system.

#### Community Seamless Software Update (CSSU)

> Seamless Software Update (SSU), is the term Nokia formerly used for over-the-air updates of Maemo (generally marketed as Maemo Update as of Maemo 5).

> The Community Seamless Software Update (CSSU) is being developed by the Maemo community as a continuation of, and expansion on, Nokia's update support. It aims to deliver fixes which would be difficult to deliver through Extras (like core Maemo packages). It won't, however, bundle software which can (or could) be installed through the Extras repositories.
